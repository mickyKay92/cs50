/*
For this problem, youâ€™ll implement a program that calculates the approximate grade level
needed to comprehend some text using Coleman-Liau index.

    - Implement your program in a file called readability.c in a directory called readability.
    - Your program must prompt the user for a string of text using get_string.
    -  Your program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text.
    - You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character
      from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that
      any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
    - Your program should print as output "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed by the
      Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.
    - If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate
      reading level), your program should output "Grade 16+" instead of giving the exact index number.
      If the index number is less than 1, your program should output "Before Grade 1".
